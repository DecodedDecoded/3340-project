COMP-3340 Project Team 1 - Front Page Documentation (Frontend)

Last updated: July 27, 2021
-------

All source code files are contained in folder 'src'.

Source code files for the homepage components are contained in subfolder 'src/Home'.

-------------------------------------------
SETUP:

Before getting started with frontend development, please do the following:

1. Delete these test default files from 'src':

-- App.test.js
-- setupTests.js
-- logo.svg

2. In App.js, remove the 'import logo from './logo.svg';' at the top of the file.
Also remove everything inside the div with className "App".

3. Open a second terminal & install Material UI by typing:
    "npm install @material-ui/core"

4. Also install Material UI Icons:
    "npm install @material-ui/icons"
    
--------------------------------------------
CODE LAYOUT:

Each page component is coded in its own separate file, and then imported into
the App.js file as an object. This simplifies the coding and makes it look much smoother
as well.
