NOTES:

Our website - HoardBoard.com (tentative name)

Purpose - HoardBoard.com is a website where users can collect and share resources in their own personal “content libraries”. These resources can be videos, images, diagrams, documents, links, embedded articles, etc. Essentially, it’s like YouTube and Instagram combined. It's a YouTube where the users can upload more than just videos.

PROJECT INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS:

There are a few things that need to be done before beginning this project. Before getting started, please make sure of the following:

1. If you don't have it already, download Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/ and make sure that both Node.js and NPM are installed.

2. Install the tools to create a React environment by entering this command into your terminal: "npm install -g create-react-app".

3. Once you have that installed, create the React app by entering this command into your terminal: "npx create-react-app app-name" where app-name is the name of your app's directory.

4. Change the working directory to your app's directory by entering: "cd app-name".

5. Start running the React app by entering: "npm start". The app should then automatically open in your browser.



WHAT COMES NEXT:

Now that the project is initialized, we can begin building the website in the React environment.

Additional instructions are provided in more specialized documentation files for each section.
